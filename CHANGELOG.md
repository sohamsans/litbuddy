## [v4.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- **BUG-115 (Persistent Chat & Model Switcher Unification)**:
  - Fixed offline desktop token (`offline_desktop_token`) rejection in `/api/auth/history` by auto-provisioning local SQLite user `offline_user`.
  - Added immediate conversation sync upon chat start and synthesis load so chats are persisted before the first user question is sent.
  - Replaced duplicate Paper Chat model picker with `<ModelSwitcherPill />` directly in the chat context bar with real-time key status.
  - Added per-topic candidate discovery persistence (`litbuddy_saved_discovery_*`) enabling instant 0ms restoration of discovered paper matrices.
  - Auto-switches active LLM provider immediately whenever a new API key is configured or updated in BYOK settings.
- **BUG-114 (Universal LLM & Gemini Q&A Fallback)**:
  - Fixed issue where selecting Google Gemini in BYOK or Model Switcher returned `"No active AI model configured or daily quota exceeded"` despite active green key pill.
  - Corrected legacy/deprecated model strings (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` -> official current `gemini-2.0-flash` & `gemini-1.5-flash`).
  - Removed strict forced `response_mime_type="application/json"` on freeform conversational Q&A to prevent Google Generative Language schema rejection errors.
  - Hardened failover cascade to only query providers with non-empty configured keys, preserving authentic error reporting rather than masking genuine API feedback.
- **BUG-113 (Cross-View Citation & Formula Insertion)**:
  - Resolved discarded citation and formula payloads when switching between Flow Maps, Reference Manager, and Writing Studio.
- **BUG-112 (Flow Maps Details Drawer Click Events)**:
  - Fixed click bubbling in Flow Maps details drawer that unmounted the side panel before citation or link actions could execute.
- **BUG-111 (Iframe / Webview Nested Scroll Layout)**:
  - Eliminated nested scrollbars in candidate paper preview tables by converting to full-bleed desktop workbench layouts.
- **BUG-110 (Word Document Writing Experience)**:
  - Upgraded Note editor to a full-featured WYSIWYG document editor with centered A4 page formatting and formatting ribbon.
- **BUG-109 (Writing Studio Citations)**:
  - Aggregated SQLite Master Reference Vault (`/api/references/all`) so all downloaded, pooled, and synthesized literature can be cited.
- **BUG-108 (Desktop Cross-Device Account Verification)**:
  - Added cloud authentication probe fallback, local password auto-verification, and deterministic SQLite DB path resolution in standalone desktop executables.
- **BUG-107 (Sidebar Topic Replay Discarding Synthesis)**:
  - Restored 0ms cached synthesis loading upon selecting past notebooks in sidebar history without triggering redundant candidate re-discovery.
- **BUG-106 (Auth & OTP Identifier Resolution)**:
  - Enabled verification by either email or username in `/api/auth/verify-code` and `/api/auth/resend-code`.
- **BUG-105 (Bulk ZIP Timeout on Web Deployments)**:
  - Bounded 6-worker concurrent downloads by an 18-second deadline to eliminate 504 Gateway Timeouts on Netlify and Render proxies.
- **BUG-104 & BUG-103 (PDF Browser Downloads)**:
  - Corrected action mismatch where server batch vaulting did not trigger browser-side file downloads.
- **BUG-102 & BUG-101 (Active Session & Chat Persistence)**:
  - Fixed state wipe on browser refresh (F5) by committing active sessions and conversational turns to `localStorage` and SQLite history.

### Added
- **Dual Workspace Identity**:
  - Full support for dual branding: **ResearchLoom** and **Samhita (संहिता)**, selectable in profile settings.
- **Universal Model Switcher Pill**:
  - Interactive top-header and in-chat dropdown with live key status indicators for Google Gemini Flash, Groq Cloud, OpenRouter Free, DeepSeek, and NVIDIA NIM.
- **Automated BYOK Provider Switching**:
  - Automatically activates newly configured keys upon save without requiring manual selector toggling.
- **Distribution Archive Packaging**:
  - Automated `.zip` compression for standalone Windows executables to prevent browser download false-positive flags.
