# LitBuddy

LitBuddy is an autonomous academic literature synthesis engine and interactive research assistant. It discovers scientific literature across open academic indexes, deduplicates candidate records, executes a two-stage relevance triage and extraction pipeline, archives full-text PDFs into a local document vault, and provides an interactive research chatbot with KaTeX mathematical formula rendering.

## Features

- **Multi-Engine Academic Discovery**: Searches OpenAlex (100,000 requests/day polite pool), arXiv API, Crossref, Europe PMC, and DOAJ without requiring paid academic subscriptions.
- **Two-Stage LLM Evaluation**:
  - **Stage 1 (Batch Triage)**: Evaluates batches of candidate abstracts simultaneously using lightweight, fast models (Groq Llama 3.1 8B or Gemini Flash 8B).
  - **Stage 2 (Deep Extraction)**: Extracts core research questions, methodologies, empirical benchmarks, and research limitations into structured schemas.
- **Local Document Vault (`LitBuddy Papers`)**: Downloads and caches full-text papers directly inside a local folder on your computer. Includes an inline in-app PDF reader.
- **Interactive Research Chatbot**: Context-grounded conversational interface for asking detailed questions across the synthesized paper collection, with dynamic KaTeX LaTeX rendering and clickable citation badges.
- **Reference Manager**: Exports formatted references across BibTeX, APA, MLA, and RIS formats, as well as Excel (`.xlsx`) and CSV tables.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Security**: API keys are encrypted locally using AES-256 via Fernet cryptography in SQLite. No keys are hardcoded or shared.

## Beta Release & Standalone Downloads

LitBuddy is distributed as a lightweight, 100% offline-ready standalone executable for Windows 10/11:

### Downloads (Windows 10/11 64-bit)
- **Direct GitHub Releases**: [https://github.com/sohamsans/litbuddy/releases](https://github.com/sohamsans/litbuddy/releases)
- **Package Archive (Recommended)**: `LitBuddy-v4.2.0-beta.1-windows-x64.zip`
- **Standalone Binary**: `LitBuddy.exe` (~173 MB, self-contained single file)
- **Requirements**: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit). No Python, Node.js, or command-line installation required. Simply extract the archive or run `LitBuddy.exe`.

### Note on Browser & Windows SmartScreen Warnings
Because LitBuddy is a free open-source student project without an expensive ($300-$500/year) commercial corporate code-signing certificate:
1. **Google Chrome / Browser Warning**: If Chrome prompts "LitBuddy.exe isn't commonly downloaded and may be dangerous", click the arrow next to the download and select **Keep** (or download the `.zip` archive instead).
2. **Windows SmartScreen Prompt**: If Windows shows "Windows protected your PC / Unknown Publisher", click **More info** and select **Run anyway**.
The application is 100% open-source, contains zero telemetry or trackers, and full source code is public and inspectable in this repository.

## Academic Downloading & Polite Pool Advisory

LitBuddy makes research collection straightforward by querying open academic indexes (OpenAlex, arXiv, Crossref, Europe PMC, Unpaywall, IPFS, Project Gutenberg, and decentralized mirrors). However, please note:

1. **Academic Publisher Paywalls & Captchas**: Major commercial publishers frequently update bot detection and paywalls. While LitBuddy exhaustively rotates across mirrors, some closed-access or copyright-restricted papers cannot be retrieved automatically. In these instances, researchers can obtain the document through their university library proxy or preferred repository and drag/import the PDF directly into LitBuddy's local vault.
2. **API Polite Pools & Rate Limits**:
   - Services like OpenAlex and Unpaywall provide generous free access through a Polite Pool when a contact email is attached.
   - LitBuddy uses a generic local identifier (`autolit@research.local`) by default so your personal email is never distributed to other users.
   - If you run intensive queries or distribute LitBuddy widely, each user can supply their own contact email in their environment or settings without rate limit conflicts.

## Bug Reports, Maintenance & Community Guidelines

We welcome your feedback, ideas, bug reports, and collaborations!

### Issue Resolution Expectations
As a student, ongoing coursework, lab assignments, and academic projects take up substantial time. However, I am committed to maintaining this project diligently:
- **Minor Bugs & Fixes**: Typically triaged and resolved within 2 to 3 days.
- **Major Features & Enhancements**: Significant capability additions will generally take between 7 to 14 days to design, implement, and verify.
- **Always Free Policy**: The promise of LitBuddy being free is forever. Any proposed feature that requires recurring subscriptions, paid backend servers, or would prevent the software from remaining 100% free and open will have to be skipped over.
- **Continuous Updates**: As I use LitBuddy daily for my own research work, I will routinely publish refinements, mirror improvements, and workflow updates.

I hope this tool makes your research journey smoother and more productive. Suggestions, contributions, and academic collaborations are warmly welcomed.

## Running Locally

### Option 1: Standalone Windows Application (`LitBuddy.exe`)

You can run LitBuddy as a native desktop application without installing Python or Node.js.

1. Compile the executable using the provided build script:
   ```cmd
   build_windows_exe.bat
   ```
2. The compiled binary will be placed at `dist/LitBuddy.exe`.
3. Launch `LitBuddy.exe`. It boots the local backend service and opens a dedicated native desktop window.
4. Downloaded papers are automatically saved to `LitBuddy Papers/` in the same directory.

---

### Option 2: Running from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Node.js 18+ and npm

#### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API service runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. OpenAPI documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

#### 2. Frontend Setup

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` in the `backend/` directory if you wish to configure default server settings:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./autolit.db
OPENALEX_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
LITBUDDY_VAULT_DIR=./LitBuddy Papers
```

API keys for LLM providers (Groq, Google Gemini, OpenRouter) can be entered directly in the application settings dialog upon startup. Keys are stored locally in an encrypted database.
